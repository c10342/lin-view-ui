## Install with npm

Npm is recommended for development. Through npm installed module package, we can easily use import or require to reference

```bash
npm install lin-view-ui --save
```

## CDN
Get the latest version from [unpkg.com/lin-view-ui](https://unpkg.com/browse/lin-view-ui/) , and import JavaScript and CSS file in your page.

### Total introduction

```javascript
<!-- import CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/browse/lin-view-ui/lib/style.css">
